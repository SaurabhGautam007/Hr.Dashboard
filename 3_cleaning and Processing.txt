d]Then Actual Process started of Cleaning and Transforming the data as per requirement

>go to format data
-:1.data cleaning and processing

2.checked the data is null or empty or not, by going to view,will check mark the qulatity column,this will show for all the column 

3.then i sort it in asecending manner,then go to remove rows enter rows no, which are empty and not required.

4.removed duplicates what are  required, shift select  last column >then right click remove duplicates.

5.then check each column is the spelling is correct or similar name then right click then replace values.

6.sometimes bi unable to detect datatype then select all with shift then go to transform and detetct datatype.
