//Analysis and Report Part//

I started working on Report , for getting the resaon of attrition in all aspects.

1.I have taken a single card of kpi visuals to show the emplyoee no. in Highlight section, so that it should fluctuate after applying filter.
>Drag the EmpId into visualization
>Then right click and select count, for showing the count of employee.
>Then i formated the visuals with text,size,font,colour,background,shadow,shape,Data label,etc.

2.I copied the visuals for Highlighting other data

3.Then we want count of attriton ,so as we have like attrition in yes or no form so then will go to format data and make conditional column
>like if yes then 1 else 0
>we can get the count of attrition
>And then Drag this Measure into copied visuals to Highlight this too.

4.Then I wanted rate or percentage of attrition ,then in bi only i go the new measure ,
applied formula and calculated it.

>rate=sum(attriton count)/sum(emp count)
>then if getting a value in o.decimal ,go to measure tools convert to percentage,and also keep upto decimal point.
>Drag this also in Kpis card for Highlighting the percentage.
